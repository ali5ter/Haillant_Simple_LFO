# Haillant LFO
Stripboard design for [David Haillant's excellent Simple LFO](https://www.davidhaillant.com/simple-lfo-1-5/). 

Really appreciating David's 'Simple' series. I build [his Simple VCA](https://www.davidhaillant.com/simple-vca/) which works wonderfully and, after building this LFO on the breadboard, decided to try [DIY Layout Creator](https://bancika.github.io/diy-layout-creator/) to knock out a stripboard design to stick in my DIY synth.

Any design tips more than welcome.
